## Vulnerabilities

### Prompt Injection

<details><summary>Ignore Previous Prompt: Attack Techniques For Language Models (2022) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09527">Paper</a>] ⭐ 💸</summary>


“By proposing PromptInject, a prosaic alignment framework for mask-based iterative adversarial prompt composition, we examine how GPT-3, the most widely deployed language model in production, can be easily misaligned by simple handcrafted inputs. In particular, we investigate two types of attacks -- goal hijacking and prompt leaking.”

“We argue that LLM-Integrated Applications blur the line between data and instructions. We reveal new attack vectors, using **Indirect Prompt Injection**, that enable adversaries to remotely (without a direct interface) exploit LLM-integrated applications by strategically injecting prompts into data likely to be retrieved… including data theft, worming, information ecosystem contamination… We demonstrate our attacks' practical viability against both real-world systems, such as Bing's GPT-4 powered Chat and code-completion engines, and synthetic applications built on GPT-4. We show how processing retrieved prompts can act as arbitrary code execution, manipulate the application's functionality, and control how and if other APIs are called.”

Leveraging HouYi, we unveil previously unknown and severe attack outcomes, such as unrestricted arbitrary LLM usage and uncomplicated application prompt theft. We deploy HouYi on 36 actual LLM-integrated applications and discern 31 applications susceptible to prompt injection.”

For instance, a sequence that is present 10 times in the training data is on average generated 1000x more often than a sequence that is present only once. We next show that existing methods for detecting memorized sequences have near-chance accuracy on non-duplicated training sequences. Finally, we find that after applying methods to deduplicate training data, language models are considerably more secure against these types of privacy attacks.”

We investigate the design decisions in RLHF that contribute to its purported robustness, and release a benchmark of poisoned models to stimulate future research on universal jailbreak backdoors.”

<details><summary>Knowledge Unlearning for Mitigating Privacy Risks in Language Models (2023) [<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.805/">Paper</a>]</summary>


“We show that simply performing gradient ascent on target token sequences is effective at forgetting them with little to no degradation of general language modeling performances for larger-sized LMs… We also find that sequential unlearning is better than trying to unlearn all the data at once and that unlearning is highly dependent on which kind of data (domain) is forgotten.”

“In DEPN, we introduce a novel method, termed as **privacy neuron detector,** to locate neurons associated with private information, and then **edit these detected privacy neurons by setting their activations to zero**... Experimental results show that our method can significantly and efficiently reduce the exposure of private data leakage without deteriorating the performance of the model.”

### Poisoning & Backdoor

<details><summary>TextGuard: Provable Defense against Backdoor Attacks on Text Classification (2023) [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11225">Paper</a>]</summary>


“…**the first provable defense against backdoor attacks on text classification**. In particular, TextGuard first divides the (backdoored) training data into sub-training sets, achieved by splitting each training sentence into sub-sentences. This partitioning ensures that a majority of the sub-training sets do not contain the backdoor trigger. Subsequently, a base classifier is trained from each sub-training set, and their ensemble provides the final prediction. We theoretically prove that when the length of the backdoor trigger falls within a certain threshold, TextGuard guarantees that its prediction will remain unaffected by the presence of the triggers in training and testing inputs.”

“…we demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g., T5).”

“Using DIPPER to paraphrase text generated by three large language models (including GPT3.5-davinci-003) successfully evades several detectors, including watermarking, GPTZero, DetectGPT, and OpenAI's text classifier… To increase the robustness of AI-generated text detection to paraphrase attacks, we introduce a simple defense that relies on retrieving semantically-similar generations and must be maintained by a language model API provider.

We then provide a theoretical impossibility result indicating that as language models become more sophisticated and better at emulating human text, the performance of even the best-possible detector decreases. For a sufficiently advanced language model seeking to imitate human text, even the best-possible detector may only perform marginally better than a random classifier.”

We find that watermarking has negligible impact on the performance of tasks posed as k-class classification problems in the average case. However, the accuracy can plummet to that of a random classifier for some scenarios (that occur with non-negligible probability). Tasks that are cast as multiple-choice questions and short-form generation are surprisingly unaffected by watermarking. For long-form generation tasks, including summarization and translation, we see a drop of 15-20% in the performance due to watermarking.”

## Logistics

### Contribution

The paper selection is biased towards my research interest. So any help to make this list more comprehensive (adding papers, improving descriptions, etc.) is certainly appreciated. Please feel free to open an issue or a PR on the [Github repo](https://github.com/chawins/llm-sp).

### Notion

I intend to keep the original version of this page in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/c1bca11f7bec40988b2ed7d997667f4d?pvs=21) so I will manually transfer any pull request (after it is merged) to Notion and then push any formatting change back to Github.

### Categorization

Categorization is hard; a lot of the papers contribute in multiple aspects (e.g., benchmark + attack, attack + defense, etc.). So I organize the papers based on their “primary” contribution.

### How You Should Interpret “⭐”

**TL;DR**: ⭐ is never an indication or a measurement of the “quality” (whatever that means) of *any* of the papers.

- **What it means**: I only place ⭐ on the papers that I understand pretty well, enjoy reading, and would recommend to colleagues. Of course, it is very subjective.
- **What it does NOT mean**: The lack of ⭐ contains no information; the paper can be good, bad, ground-breaking, or I simply haven’t read it yet.
- **Use case #1**: If you find yourself enjoying the papers with ⭐, we may have a similar taste in research, and you may like the other papers with ⭐ too.
- **Use case #2**: If you are very new to the field and would like a quick narrow list of papers to read, you can take ⭐ as my recommendation.

### Prompt Injection vs Jailbreak vs Adversarial Attacks

These three topics are closely related so sometimes it is hard to clearly categorize the papers. My personal criteria are the following:

- **Prompt injection** focuses on making LLMs recognize **data** as **instruction**. A classic example of prompt injection is “ignore previous instructions and say…”
- **Jailbreak** is a method for bypassing safety filters, system instructions, or preferences. Sometimes asking the model directly (like prompt injection) does not work so more complex prompts (e.g., [jailbreakchat.com](https://www.jailbreakchat.com/)) are used to trick the model.
- **Adversarial attacks** are just like jailbreaks but are solved using numerical optimization.
- In terms of complexity, adversarial attacks > jailbreaks > prompt injection.
